# Voice LLM Transcription Comparison

## Goal & Scope
Select the voice transcription API that best fits the mobile Claude Code experience. The comparison focuses on real-time streaming performance, transcript quality, pricing, and integration friction. Findings feed back into the mobile interface work once a primary provider is chosen.

## Candidates Under Review
- **AssemblyAI Streaming**: Known for balanced accuracy and cost.
- **Deepgram Nova Streaming**: Prioritizes low latency and developer tooling.
- **Wispr Flow**: Promises cutting-edge accuracy via LLM-enhanced transcription.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Latency**: End-to-end time from speech to final text.
- **Accuracy**: Word error rate on technical and conversational prompts.
- **API Ergonomics**: Ease of authentication, streaming, and error handling.
- **Cost**: Published or quoted pricing per minute of audio.
- **Integration Fit**: How well the API slots into the mobile Claude Code pipeline.

## Deliverable
Produce a decision matrix summarizing strengths, weaknesses, and recommended provider. Surface any blockers (e.g., missing features, pricing constraints) that would delay integration.
