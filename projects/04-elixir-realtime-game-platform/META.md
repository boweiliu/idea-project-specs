Continue working on 04-elxir spec. Now, focus on the subproject of #N. You should still read claude.md, meta.md, readme.md. then create a new subfolder that contain more specific docs.

We need to set up a list of code components to build, a list of flows to instrument/test, and start looking into specific libraries and frameworks. 

But first we should make sure the details given in the doc are sufficiently fine grained. The goal is to get the spec off to a good start - someone else will continue working after us, and also another team will be in charge of implementation. They will be using a LLM tool so make sure to include some good LLM prompts. Feel free to ask me questions rather than making decisions on your own.
