# IPC Layer Workbench

- **Scope**: Deepen Subproject 2 (High-Performance Worker IPC) with actionable build targets, test flows, library research, and LLM prompts.
- **Audience**: Spec writers handing off to implementation + future LLM teammates.
- **Artifacts**:
  - `COMPONENTS.md` — code modules and responsibilities.
  - `FLOWS.md` — instrumentation + test scenarios.
  - `LIBRARIES.md` — runtime/framework evaluation.
  - `LLM_PROMPTS.md` — ready-to-use prompt seeds.
- **Status (2025-10-13)**: Drafted initial deep dive. Review for alignment with `OVERVIEW.md` when new decisions land.

Next writer: review unanswered questions in `../QUESTIONS.md` (items 6-9) and extend docs with confirmed decisions rather than speculative options.
