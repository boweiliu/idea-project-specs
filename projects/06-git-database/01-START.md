Goals

1. Enable the flow of "Just start writing/prompting/drafting" - like obsidian/notion. You don't have to "be" anywhere
2. Easy add - commit - push workflow for prompts (cuz they usu are self-committing).
3. Still enable git merge, revert workflows. retroactive branching.
4. LLM agents insta-push; if they have merges they can and should pre-resolve amongst themselves
5. Allow diffs / reviews to be sortable and have custom metadata attached. Would be nice to do this in such a way as to be compatible with preexisting vanilla git review tooling.
6. Make it easy to remember what we were working on.

Steal ideas from ideaflow.app:

1. Link stuff via "+" and then it gets embedded in a little text box
2. Hash tags via "#"

I wonder if there are any tools to bring live collab editing to vim... ideally i'd like a vim buffer which acts smart like the ideaflow page.
