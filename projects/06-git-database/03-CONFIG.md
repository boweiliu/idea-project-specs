UNDECIDED THINGS

1. what git branch do we "live" on?
1. where is the default folder for stuff
1. what is the project name?
1. we want this to be able to represent ANY db schema right? how to specify which tables are append-only (so we only store the latest snapshot) vs. not?
1. what format for file-ified rows? jsonl vs. toml
2. meta: Where do we put config, to specify all of the above?
3. what do we call "index.html" (the default file name if we want to try to put content into folders)?
