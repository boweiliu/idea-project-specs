# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains technical specs for future project ideas. Each project lives in `projects/XX-project-name/` with an OVERVIEW.md following standardized guidelines.

**Current Project**: `01-mobile-friendly-LLM-coder` - A mobile web interface for Claude Code to enable coding while desktop is busy with other tasks.

## Spec Writing Standards

**Critical**: All specs must follow guidelines in `meta.md`. Always reference `meta.md` before writing or editing any spec to ensure compliance with established standards.

## Current State

- **Language/Framework**: English markdown
- **Build System**: N/A
- **Testing**: N/A
- **Dependencies**: N/A

## Development Workflow

Spec creation follows: problem identification → stack research → user flow mapping → technical design → review against `meta.md` guidelines.

**Important**: After updating any documentation, always review the changes against `meta.md` principles. Look for repetition, unclear sections, or violations of the succinctness priority. Fix immediately.
